Expert Analytics consists of consultants with an extensive background in scientific research, teaching, programming and science education and communication. A few of us even have a long lecturing experience at different departments of the University of Oslo.

We offer courses in a wide range of topics. Below you will find a few
of these topics, sorted by programming language. If you have something
in mind that is not listed, feel free to let us know. We can easily
tailor courses as needed, if it is inside our scope of knowledge.
