In todays world of everything distributed, making a system do
the right thing is not always an easy task. Adding to that, requirements that
constantly evolve, and business owners who often like to use the new and
shiny things. Developing software systems in a maintainable way with focus on
correctness then becomme a nice challenge. And we are up to the it - our
software engineers usually consider the case more interesting, the more complex it gets.

Consultants at Expert Analytics have participated in large systems devlopment projects 
with many of our clients, and often take on roles as tech lead, lead
developer or technical architect. And we are eager at keeping up with modern
trends such as variants of agile development, test-driven development, and
DevSecOps. As such, a narrow view on the programming environment is not
sufficient, but rather a holistic view that includes databases, run time and
testing environments, continous integration and deployment in addition to the
development environment itself.

When it comes to the actual tools that are used in a project, we try to be
pretty agnostic. The preferences and competences of the client are usually the
deciding factors when several tools can do the job.
We are fine with that, and can adapt, as we have through the years come to
understand that a tool often just decide the syntax. We contribute with deeper
understanding and ability to solve the problems at hand - solutions can
then be coded up in the selected environment. There are however situations where
we understand that a tool is very wrong for the problem to be solved, and then
we will speak out.

To get the full picture of the languages, tools, and environments that Expert
Analytics can use for your project, the individual CVs of our employees must be
consulted. What we most often use is Python, Java, Go, and C++. We have worked
extensively with Postgres, Azure SQL, Google Datastore and Firestore, and Cosmos
DB. For continous testing and integration we are familiar with most of the main
players, and we have deployed on Google, Azure, and Amazon cloud solutions.
