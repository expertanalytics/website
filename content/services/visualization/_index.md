Concise and informative visualisation is the key for comprehension and
communication of data and analysis results. Especially these days where the
amount of data is often huge and traditional visualisation forms may not be
suitable. Treatments like data reduction or aggregation are then needed
to visualise the data efficiently.

Visualisation of data plays an important role in data science, machine learning
and analysis platforms. Raw data needs to be inspected, results of
computational simulations and algorithms need to verified, and the end-users
need insight into the data too. Given the large amounts of data available in
today's analyses, implementing efficient and responsive visualization software
is far from trivial.

Our consultants have expertise in standard and advanced data visualisation
techniques. This includes pretreatments such as reduction, aggregation and
contextualising of data. For more complex visualization of larger data sets, a
combination of different techniques is often required. For instance, deriving
some statistical measures across spatial, temporal and parametric dimensions
can be combined with blending techniques to provide novel visual insight.
