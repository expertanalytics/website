One of Europe's largest generators of renewable energy and leading company in
hydropower set out to explore the potential of digitalization for its hydropower
plants. Our team of consultants developed a machine learning platform, the surrounding
backend infrastructure as well as visualization tools to explore and analyse
sensor data for both specific use cases as well as across the entire fleet.

We explore the data in close collaboration with the maintenance team on site and apply
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to monitor various kinds of failure modes
from slowly developing failures over time to repeating failures in the auxiliary equipment.
This kind of condition monintoring supports the daily maintenance by improving the
predictability of wear and asset failures, thus reducing operating costs and the need for
costly and time-consuming manual inspections.
