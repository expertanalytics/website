Vegard obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics from the
University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory in 2019 and worked as a researcher at Simula between 2019 and 2023. In his research he worked with health data, mathematical models and computer simulations to understand fluid flow in the human brain. Both physical based (differential equations) and data driven (statistical, machine learning) models were used in his research.
