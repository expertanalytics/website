Naeeme is an enthusiastic programmer with many years of experience as a software 
developer and project engineer. She holds a bachelor's degree in chemical 
engineering and a master's degree in environmental engineering from University
of Stuttgart, Germany. Before joining our team, she worked in the field of 3D 
modelling and CFD simulation of reactive and non-reactive flows, where 
she consulted her customers how to optimize their operational units and find
sources of suboptimal performances by using high-performance computing for 
detailed simulation of complex 3D models and presented the result of
her simulations in immersive virtual environments.

During her career, she worked intensively in developing tools for 3D 
modelling of complex geometries (mesh generation) and programs for
advanced visualization of data in 2D and 3D environments, e.g. automated image
processing from simulation data. Her main programming languages are Python and 
Fortran.

As a project engineer, she attained knowledge in handling measurement data in 
industrial units, analysing and visualizing them in a comprehensive way.
She also had the chance to work closely with engineers in different
industrial fields, sometimes climbing up a 150 meters boiler, sometimes even 
looking at sugar production or a paper factory.
