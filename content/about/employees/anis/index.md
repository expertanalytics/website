Anis holds a PhD in Fluid Mechanics from the University of Oslo. Before joining us, he completed a three-year postdoctoral fellowship, which included research stays at PUC-Rio, Brazil and Princeton University, USA. 

Anis's main research interests are related to non-linear dynamics associated with multiphase phase flows, wind-generated waves, wall-bounded turbulence and aerodynamics. His research approach has mainly consisted of employing advanced experimental techniques including non-intrusive optical methods. He also has experience with numerical modeling and simulation. Anis is comfortable with analysis and processing of large datasets, he has experience with various programming languages including Python and Matlab and he is familiar with AI / Machine Learning. Anis's academic background and analytical and curious mindset enable him to adapt to new challenges and systematically solve complex problems.
