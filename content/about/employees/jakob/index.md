Jakob submitted his master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at
the University of Oslo in 2016. His educational background is in mathematics
and computational science applied on mechanical problems using numerical
methods.

This has fuelled his interest for science and technology. He has mainly used
Python and has substantial experience using numerical libraries such as
Numpy/Scipy and FEniCS. He is also familiar with C/C++ and Java. His experience
includes teaching introductory Python at the University of Oslo, mostly in
one-to-one settings.

Before joining Expert Analytics he was engaged as a Research Engineer at Simula
Research Laboratory. In his thesis he simulated the cerebrospinal fluid flow in
patient specific geometries. He solved partial differential equations with the
finite element method using supercomputers, both in his master's thesis and
during his work at Simula. Through his education and work he has gained
significant experience with numerical simulations and mathematical modelling,
as well as problem solving in general.
