Eivind has a masters degree in Computational Science from the
University of Oslo, completed in 2016. His project investigated a
particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating linear
algebra computations using GPUs. From the studies leading to his
degree he has gained broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical
mathematics, and programming in several languages.

Prior work experience includes teaching programming: mostly one-to-one
teaching in a lab setting, but also as lecturing and live coding in
plenary settings. He has also worked with testing---both manual and
automated, and with Android development and some minor Javascript
development.
