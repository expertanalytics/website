Bernardo obtained a PhD in Natural Sciences from the University of Oslo in
2014. He has over a decade of experience working with mathematical modelling
and scientific computing in multiple fields including engineering, medicine, 
pharmacology and biology.

His areas of expertise include numerical methods, simulation of multiphysics
problems, signal processing and parallel computing.  In recent years he has
worked mostly with Python, but he also has experience with C++ and other
programming languages.  His multidisciplinary background and well-developed
communication skills allows him to work efficiently both independently and as
part of large teams, bridging any gaps between technical problem solving and
non-technical end users.
