Trygve holds a master's degree in Industrial Mathematics at NTNU in 2015, and
has submitted a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics at the University of Oslo in
2019. In his thesis Trygve developed, analysed and implemented efficient
algorithms for solving systems of equations related to fluid flow in the brain.

As such, he has substantial experience in development of numerical computer
code -- mainly in Python, C and C++, and related libraries and tools for
multi-language programming.

Trygve is analytical, curious and easily fascinated. This makes him eager to
learn and well-adapted to work both as part of a team, and independently.
