Vinzenz is a curious, pragmatic, creative problem solver. He holds a
PhD in biomechanical engineering, focusing on stochastic simulations
of the blood flow in the human arterial system. This interdisciplinary
work included working within engineering, medicine, biology, software
development and statistics.

His educational background is in mechanical engineering, with focus on
numerical methods and bio-materials. Beside his studies, he has worked
in several different fields such as virtual commissioning, petroleum
research, biomechanics research. His educational and work experience
gives him strong analytic skills, the ability to see problems from
different angles and has strengthened his communications skills.

In the last years he has mainly been programming in Python, which he
has used to write a comprehensive simulation software. He is also
familiar with other languages, like C and C++, and can easily adapt
beyond this.
