Asma is an engineer and Ph.D in civil engineering. Her research topic is within the field of Structural
Engineering. In particular, her focus is within the assessment and retrofitting of steel structures.
This includes modeling, synthesis, characterization, and probabilistic analysis of steel structu-
res. In more detail, her experiences is about an analytical and numerical study of pre-fatigued
treated cracked structures. Then go one step further to engineering applications to facilitate
an extension of the service life of existing steel structures, such as bridges, offshore structures,
and wind turbine.
