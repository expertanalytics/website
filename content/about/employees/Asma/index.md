Asma is an engineer and Ph.D in civil engineering. Her research topic was within the field of Structural Engineering. In particular, her focus was within the assessment and retrofitting of steel structures. This included modeling, synthesis, characterization, and probabilistic analysis of steel structures. Her main expertise was thus in analytical and numerical studies of pre-fatigued treated cracked structures. In her role prior to joining Expert Analytics, Asma made use of these experiences for engineering applications in order to facilitate an extension of the service life of existing steel structures, such as bridges, offshore structures, and wind turbine.
