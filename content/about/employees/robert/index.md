Robert Solli is a specialist in scientific programming, with expertise in mathematical optimisation,
statistical analysis and machine learning. He has solved a varied set of problems with this skillset, from 
understanding complex physical systems to increasing student volunteer participation.

Robert submitted his master's degree in Computational Physics in 2019. In the thesis, Robert analysed 
events in a nuclear physics experiment to separate reaction products using machine learning 
techniques. He completed the degree at the University of Oslo where he also worked as a research assistant. 
In his work as a research assistant, he analysed and wrote a paper on understanding student interactions with 
an online video course. 

Robert is also an avid climber and takes as much delight in finding solutions to hard problems on a sheer 
rock-face as to those presented by data.
