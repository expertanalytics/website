Eleonora obtained her PhD degree in applied mathematics from the
University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory (Oslo, Norway) in 2023, and her Master's degree in Aeronautical engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 2015. 
During her doctoral studies, she developed efficient solvers and robust formulations for poroelasticity equations applied to model brain displacements and fluid flow.
From 2019 to 2023, Eleonora worked as a research and development engineer at FLIR Unmanned Aerial Systems AS (Hvalstad, Norway). 
In that role, she focused on improving the aerodynamical performances of drones using both numerical models and practical experiments.
