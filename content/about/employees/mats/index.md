Max has a PhD (2014) in Aerospace Engineering (INPE, Brazil) and two postdoctoral experiences: one in Applied Mathematics, at IMPA (Brazil, 2014-2016) and another in Chemistry, at the University of Bergen (2016-2019). He has experience and interest in multiphase flow, reactive flows, flows in porous media, heat transfer, CFD, to name a few. Additionally, he has programming experience in Fortran, Matlab, Python and Octave.

More than the scientific capabilities, Max's expertise relies on its experience in bridging fundamental and applied science.
