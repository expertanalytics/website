Diako holds a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from the University of Oslo. As
a student at both Mathematics and Physics departments at the University of Oslo, 
he has acquired a broad knowledge in various physical and mathematical theories, 
and numerical methods. During his Ph.D. period he has been involved in several 
projects within multiple research groups at the Faculty of Mathematics and 
Natural Sciences. He has developed high performance numerical codes, in C/C++ 
and Python/Cython combining various numerical methods, to study plasma-object 
interactions and ionospheric instabilities and turbulence. In addition, he has 
developed new analytical models describing the interactions between electrically 
conducting objects and plasmas.

Through his education, Diako has developed strong analytical and numerical skills 
to solve complex problems related to phenomena arising in the natural world.
