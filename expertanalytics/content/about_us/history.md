Expert Analytics was born in 2013 out of a shared vision between two passionate researchers, 
Åsmund Ødegård and Ola Skavhaug.
Both had spent years working at Simula Research Laboratory, where they honed their expertise in complex 
simulations and cutting-edge technologies.
But their ambition extended beyond academia — they wanted to take their knowledge into the real world, tackling the tough,
unsolved problems faced by industries.
This drive led them to start Expert Analytics, where they could bridge the gap between 
research and practical, high-impact solutions.

In the early days, the company focused on pioneering projects, like creating digital payment solutions and
developing open-source simulator software for operational hydrology.
As these efforts gained traction, Åsmund and Ola began expanding the team,
bringing on board brilliant minds from universities—engineers and researchers with advanced degrees,
who shared their passion for solving the most challenging industrial problems.
Today, Expert Analytics is a diverse team of 40 experts, working with industries in hydropower,
energy, industrial automation, and even oncology.
The journey has been driven by a desire to push boundaries and make a real-world difference,
and that mission continues to define the company’s work every day.
