Robert finished his PhD at the University of Oslo in 2019.
His thesis involved solving highly non-linear systems of differential equations
with parallel computing and analysing gigabytes of output data.
His scientific background and curious mind is a strong combination for finding
and synthesizing knowledge, as well as for quickly adapting to new situations.
In addition to science and programming, he has a passion for teaching 
and explaining technical concepts in an easily understandable way.
