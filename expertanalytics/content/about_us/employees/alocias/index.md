Alocias has a master's degree in physics from the University of Oslo, submitted
in spring 2018. The subject of the thesis was Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
of Quantum dots constrained in single- and double well potentials. He solved
the numerical problem for both systems with new analytic expressions which had
not been explicitly done before and a newer method with roots in machine
learning to further improve upon the results.

Solving these complex systems gave him a varied skill set within the fields of
numerical methods, statistical analysis, mathematical optimization, symbolic
computation and high performance computing. This has made him experienced in
programming with multiple languages and skilled in efficient algorithmic
approaches.

With his education in Computational Physics and a curious mindset, Alocias is a
positive learner and well-adapted for solving complex problems.
