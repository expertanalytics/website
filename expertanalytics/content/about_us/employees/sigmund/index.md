Sigmund submitted his masters's degree in Geophysics and Seismology at 
the University of Oslo in 2019. The subject of the thesis was Attenuation 
of Seismic Interference Noise using Convolutional Neural Networks and was 
written in collaboration with CGG Services AS. This work gave insight in 
the fields of machine learning and seismic signal processing.

Working with industrial problems utilizing machine learning has given him 
experience with convolutional neural networks and seismic data processing  
and further led to a consultancy job at Lundin Norway AS working on related 
projects. He has mainly used Python and has experience with machine learning 
frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, as well as numerical libraries 
such a Numpy. He is also familiar with MATLAB, C++ and Bash.
