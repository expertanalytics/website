Christian holds a PhD in fluid mechanics from the University of Oslo, 
where he also worked as a postdoctoral researcher. His expertise includes 
mathematical modeling, numerical methods and programming. Christian
enjoys working in interdisciplinary environments and applying this knowledge
to contribute to real-world solutions.

During his PhD studies, he was involved in several research projects collaborating
with multiple international research institutes. His main responsibility was the assessment
of experimental data, including creating software for data analysis and visualization, 
the development of theoretical models, and the
software implementation of numerical solvers. In his time in academia, he worked 
on problems related to elastohydrodynamics, lubrication, multiphase flow, 
charging of supercapacitors, and biomechanics. 
In addition, he has also worked with machine learning by combining neural networks with a  
reinforcement learning framework for flow optimization problems
in tubular networks.

Besides research, Christian is also an experienced lecturer and he has taught several 
courses in fluid mechanics at the University of Oslo as well as supervising students, 
both at the master's and PhD levels.
