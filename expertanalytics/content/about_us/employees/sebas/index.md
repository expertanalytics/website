Sebastian is a curious person always looking to learn about 
new topics and combining them into novel solutions to complex 
problems. He received his PhD in biocomputional sciences in 
March 2021 from the Italian Institute of Technology/University 
of Bologna, where he studied how nanomaterials interact with 
physiological environments. He is experienced in molecular 
simulations, data visualization, and scientific writing. 
In more recent years, Sebastian has been applying bioinformatic 
methods to genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data.

During his PhD, Sebastian managed large amounts of data 
(hundreds of gigabytes) generated from molecular simulations. 
In this type of computation, numerical methods are used to 
iteratively solve coupled differential equations, which in turn 
offers an atomic description of physicochemical processes.

When approaching a scientific problem, Sebastian looks 
for inspiration in Nature, which has perfected behaviors 
(e.g. preying strategies) over millions of years.

Sebastian is particularly drawn to creative, unconventional
ways of displaying data. He is passionate about generative art,
dancing, and animals. His values are based on critical thinking,
diversity, inclusion, and teaching.
