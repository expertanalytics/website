Software Engineering is the disciplined application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing,
and maintenance of software.
It involves a systematic approach to creating high-quality software solutions that meet specific user requirements
and function reliably in real-world conditions.
This field encompasses a wide range of activities, including requirements analysis, software design, coding, testing,
deployment, and ongoing maintenance.
Software engineers use various programming languages, tools, and methodologies to build scalable, efficient,
and secure software systems.
They also employ best practices such as version control, code reviews, and automated testing to ensure
the software is robust and maintainable.
