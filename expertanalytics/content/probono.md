In our pro bono programme we seek to find solutions to interesting data science challenges together with problem owners
using both classical methods and modern machine learning and data science techniques.
Our target audience is composed by research institutes and groups, early start-ups, NGOs, and other (funding-limited) companies.

The programme is pro bono as we will use our excess capacity in it, both as part of our internal training programme aimed
at furthering the professional development of our researchers, as well as part of meaningful onboarding of new employees.

A pro bono project will usually be limited to 100 hours of work.

Some example use cases are:

- Exploratory data analysis — Do you need solutions for a broad-framed problem?

- Workflow automation — Do you have a lot of data, but need smoother data flow?

- Predictive analysis — Can Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence be used in your data pipeline? 

- Feasibility studies — Do you have a specific hypothesis that needs investigating?

- Data visualisation — How to plot complex data in a meaningful way?

### To apply

Submit a 1-2 page proposal for a pro bono project to <probono@xal.no>. The application should describe the problem space,
available data, and desired outcome.

### Selection and initial mapping

Typically, there is a two-week review period before approval or rejection.
Discuss a roadmap, timeline, and deliverables for the project.
Both parties will sign a simple non-disclosure agreement to protect both interests.

### Project

Start-up meeting with the end-user and the expert(s) working on the project.
The end user is invited to contribute to the project as they see fit.

### End of the project

Present our results to the client.
Hand over the deliverables outlined in the agreement.
Social media engagement from the end user would be greatly appreciated.
