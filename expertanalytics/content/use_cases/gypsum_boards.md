Norgips, a Norwegian producer and supplier of gypsum boards across Norway and
Europe, aimed to enhance its production processes by utilizing sensor data collected
from its factory. The primary challenge was to transform this vast stream of data into
actionable insights to reduce costs and improve product quality.

### Approach

To meet this challenge, we designed and implemented an analytics pipeline that
consolidated and processed sensor data into actionable insights. This involved
orchestrating machine learning models in both production and development
environments to analyze patterns and predict quality metrics. Additionally, we
created dashboards to help operators with real-time insights into production
performance.

We adopted a dual-model approach: one model predicted the quality measurement,
enabling continuous monitoring, while another model aimed to adjust a critical
factory parameter to stabilize the product quality. Although the second model
requires further refinement to achieve optimal performance, it lays the groundwork
for more stable production processes.

### Impact

The project provided operational insights into previously unexplored areas of the
factory line. Additionaly, we revealed that product quality was more variable than
anticipated. This variability had significant implications for machine tuning, which
could lead to more stable production and reduced costs. The dashboards delivered
included continuous predictions of quality metrics, allowing operators to monitor
real-time changes rather than relying on sparse quality samples. The project ended
before full-scale implementation. However, further work based on these results could
help Norgips achieve more stable product quality and significant cost savings by
minimizing the need for downstream corrections in the factory pipeline.
