Together with Cognite and AkerBP, our consultants built a Smart Monitoring tool to
identify the root cause of high oil-in-water concentrations with the goal to reduce production losses.

### Approach

By taking into account measurements from 200 physical sensors and 100 virtual sensors,
our consultants leveraged their physical science and software skills to develop a machine-learning proxy model
that could identify the most likely actor when there was a high oil-in-water concentration in the production pipeline.

The smart monitoring system displays near real-time data and performs calculations combining sensor values
and simulator outputs,providing engineers with virtual sensors and physical properties readily available for analysis.

### Impact

The developed system gives engineers the ability to troubleshoot issues related to water contamination in a single dashboard,
increasing their situational awareness. This allows users to take informed actions based on the available data and
solve problems faster.

Aker BP estimates an increase revenue potential of $6 millions. The system can also prevent environmental incidents.
