We helped one of our clients in the Maritime Industry to develop a finite-element simulator to guide
their technical choices when designing their boats.

The biggest challenge that our client had was that their innovative vessel design prevented the use of
the classical Hydrodynamic Theory for some of the required analysis. In order to attack this problem, our consultants,
together with the client's Subject Matter Experts, derived a new mathematical theory suitable for the client vessel's design.
Then, we developed a finite-element solver to perform numerical simulations to be used as a guide for
the client's engineering choices when designing their boat.

The numerical simulator was developed combining industry standard best practices, such as version control, Docker,
open-source packages, and user-friendliness (the intrincate details of the finite-element solver was not-exposed to the end-user).
