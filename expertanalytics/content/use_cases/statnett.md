For Statnett, we have assisted in two strategically important projects.
First, by making compiled data accessible to Statnett's team of analysts in the planning and operations environments.
Later, as part of the team during the implementation of flow-based market coupling.

In both projects, we contributed Data Science resources.
For flow-based market coupling, we leveraged strong scientific expertise to contribute to
the design of quality improvement efforts for the project.
In the development of the platform and service for making data accessible,
we also contributed with system development expertise and technical leadership.
To make data available in the simplest possible way required intimate knowledge of complex industry standards,
which had to be simplified to enable an intuitive approach for an analyst.

Both projects were highly prioritized and strategically important for Statnett,
and our collaboration has contributed to the high professional quality of the deliveries we supported,
while also ensuring highly efficient use of resources.
