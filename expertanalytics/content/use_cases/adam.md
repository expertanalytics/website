Long term power production planning involves resolving a comprehensive market
model with power consumers, producers, and transmission lines, down to the
individual reservoirs and hydro power stations and pumps in coupled water
courses. This is done by running simulation software that outputs a fairly
large amount of data in the range of 15 - 20 GB each time a simulation is run.

We have helped building an analysis platform for this problem that contains a
domain model in which simulation results are inserted after they are computed.
Furthermore, we have developed advanced techniques for retrieving and
visualizing the results in terms of time series data and statistics, along with
advanced aggregation of results to allow forecasts to be viewed in ways earlier
not feasible.
