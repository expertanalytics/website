This project focused on developing a comprehensive data platform designed to support the collection,
analysis, and modeling of large datasets for energy management.
The platform integrates legacy systems with modern cloud solutions,
enabling seamless data flows for forecasting and predictive maintenance.
It handles third-party data sources, such as meteorological data, and internal measurement data,
providing the foundation for advanced analytics that drive critical business decisions
and operational improvements.

Our team played a key role in developing predictive maintenance solutions that significantly
extended the lifespan of vital equipment.
By leveraging advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms,
the platform could identify potential equipment failures before they occur, allowing for timely interventions.
This proactive maintenance approach resulted in reduced downtime and optimized
the performance of essential energy assets, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and extending equipment longevity.

We implemented an end-to-end monitoring system powered by AI, integrated with the client’s infrastructure,
and designed to provide real-time insights. Utilizing a combination of technologies, such as Python, Azure,
and containerized microservices, our team ensured the platform’s scalability and reliability.
The solution helped improve decision-making in energy management and led to significant cost savings
by preventing equipment failures and allowing for higher performance under optimized conditions.
