A new method of calculating power transmission capacities for the day-ahead power market in
the Nordic countries was introduced at the beginning of November 2024. This new method,
called Flow-Based Market Coupling (FBMC), represents a significant change in power market
operations.

Our customer required assistance in developing a short-term power price forecasting
model to meet the November deadline. The model needed to comprehensively describe
production and consumption across all Nordic price areas, including capacities of international
interconnector cables. A key requirement was the modelâ€™s ability to integrate daily published
power line transmission capacities.

## Solution: our approach

Our consultant joined the client's internal team to:

- Establish a comprehensive domain model to organize input data
- Set up the optimization problem
- Develop analytical tools for forecasting
- Document the mathematical foundations for internal reference.

Our consultant's background in the renewable power sector and experience from the colleagues at XAL
provided important domain expertise.

## Results

The model was completed before the November deadline and successfully deployed on the first
day of Flow-Based Market Coupling.
