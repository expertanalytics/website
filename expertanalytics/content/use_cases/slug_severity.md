Slugging occurs when irregular surges of gas and liquid flow through pipelines, often due to variations in pressure,
flow rates, or system design, causing instability in downstream processes. Intensive slugging in oil and gas
production systems such as separators poses critical operational risks, including:
• Gas flaring,
• Oil dripping events,
• Costly production stops, and
• Equipment damage requiring extensive repairs.
Our client, a major oil and gas operator, required a sophisticated solution to evaluate the severity of slugging as it
enters a separator. The model has to handle varying levels of system knowledge, integrate seamlessly with existing
operations and work in both real-time scenarios and for evaluation of large-scale simulation results of future
operarions.

### Approach

We developed a flexible, multi-level framework of Slugging Severity Indicators, tailored to the client’s system and
data availability. The solution delivered insights at varying levels of granularity, based on the level of system
instrumentation and available data:

1. General Indicator (Minimal System Knowledge)
    - Description: Spectral analysis of pressure and temperature variations (common measures at various points
in the system)
    - Application: Provides quick assessments with minimal system-specific input, enabling scalable
deployment across diverse applications.

2. Intermediate Indicator (Flow Rate Knowledge)
    - Description: Uses flow rates, derived from multiphase flow meters or transient flow simulations, to
calculate surge volumes of slugs entering the separator.
    - Application: ONers a more detailed evaluation, ideal for systems equipped with flow measurement tools or
modeled data.

3. System specific Indicator (Digital Twin)
    - Description: Incorporates a digital twin of the aNected components (separator and drainage control
system), simulating real-world operations to predict slugging behavior.
    - Application: Provides the most detailed analysis, supporting precise optimization of, e.g., separator
performance.

The framework is designed to be modular, allowing the client to adopt the level of analysis most suitable for their
operational context and scale up as needed.

### Impact

Once fully implemented, the Slugging Severity Indicators enable significant operational benefits, including:

- Improved Monitoring: Real-time evaluations allow for a proactive responses to slugging events, reducing
the risk of unplanned production stops.
- Enhanced Reliability: Optimized separator and drainage system performance increase overall system
reliability.
- Cost and Environmental Savings: Fewer flaring and oil dripping incidents minimize both operational costs
and environmental impact.
- Future-Proofing: Improved evaluation of scenario modeling using commercial multiphase flow simulators
to plan for future operations and mitigate potential risks.
