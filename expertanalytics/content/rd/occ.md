Expert Analytics is a member of the [Oslo Cancer Cluster](https://oslocancercluster.no/).
Our goal as a member is to leverage our software development and data analytics skills to help the health sector
in devising strategies for cancer treatment.

As members of the OCC, we were approached by the [CellFit Project](https://cellfitproject.com/), a consortium
of collaboration between Oslo University Hospital, Oslo Cancer Cluster, SINTEF and Thermo Fisher Scientific,
which addresses cell-based cancer therapy. From this approach, the CytoFit project was born!

CytoFit is a software solution that automates the processing of cytometry data.
Despite being a key component of personalized precision medicine, cytometry data analysis often involves
subjective user input that compromises the robustness of the results.
Cytofit aims to streamline the storage, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of these data in a user-friendly
cloud-based application, enhancing collaboration between clinical laboratories, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
The software addresses inefficiencies in current systems by integrating advanced analysis models and high-quality visualizations,
ultimately improving the quality of healthcare and accelerating the development of patient-centered therapies.

We are using Cytofit to analyze proteomics datasets from Oslo University Hospital and optimize experimental cancer treatments.
This is accomplished by profiling the immune system of individual patients and look for biomarkers that predict
clinical outcomes like treatment responsiveness.

We are thrilled to utilise our scientific and software background to develop meaningful solution in the fight against cancer!

The project was presented in [The Intelligent Health Conference 2024](https://film.oslomet.no/the-intelligent-health-conference-2)
("The CellFit Project").
