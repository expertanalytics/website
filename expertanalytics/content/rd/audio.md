The health of your equipment can be measured by the sound it makes. This fact, exploited by technicians for decades,
inspired our  journey to develop our edge audio analytics system that  will record and learn from the machine sounds.
The result is a robust and performant monitoring system that will alert you when sudden events or creeping changes
require your attention.

Our Edge Audio Analytics solution is capable of continuously recording and analysing up to 16 channels of 48kHz each on
the edge hardware, and is equipped with a cloud agnostic control system utilising MQTT as the communication protocol.

On the edge, we run tens of models to capture the audio features and understand them. These models can be simple,
like calculating the total loudness from a microphone, or advanced machine learning models used to classify
certain audio patterns of interest.
Only the relevant information, in terms of time series and audio snippets are uploaded to the cloud, reducing
the cloud cost by several orders of magnitude.

Our Edge Audio Analytics solution was developed in partnership with [Ã… Energi](https://www.aenergi.no/no),
[StepSolutions](https://stepsolutions.no/), with partial funding from [Innovasjon Norge](https://en.innovasjonnorge.no/).

Expert Analytics was part of the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence Systems (DAIS)](https://dais-project.eu/) initiative,
which is a pan-European project aimed at bringing faster and more secure data processing solutions through
the development of edge AI software and hardware components.
This large consortium was funded by the European Union's [Horizon 2020](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101007273)
research and innovation program.
