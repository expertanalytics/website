Our consultants have experience in the FinTech sector, where we helped develop customized solutions to manage risk,
comply with rules and regulations, and detect and analyze potential fraudulent transactions.

We have experience working with end-users and managers to plan and implement technical solutions.
Our consultants have worked alongside the clients' teams, developing data models, crafting ML algorithms,
creating dashboards, and establishing pipelines.
Moreover, we helped our clients to operationalize their data-driven ambitions, by orchestrating deployment and
operation of Kubernetes clusters on cloud platforms.
